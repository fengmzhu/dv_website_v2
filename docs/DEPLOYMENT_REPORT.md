# Start the environment
./start.sh

# Verify containers are running
docker ps
```

### 2. Database Schema Validation ✅

**IT Domain Schema Changes:**

- **Fields:** 17 total fields including auto-generated task_index
- **Validation:** All constraint checks and triggers properly defined
- **Status:** ✅ Ready for deployment

**NX Domain Schema Changes:**
- **Enhanced Tables:** coverage_reports, version_control, imported_it_data
- **TO Summary View:** 33+ fields with proper data joins
- **Validation:** Data validation constraints for coverage percentages (0-100%)
- **Status:** ✅ Ready for deployment

### 3. Migration Script Analysis ✅

**Safety Features:**
- ✅ Creates timestamped backups before changes

- ✅ Validates data integrity after migration

**Migration Components:**
- ✅ Backup table creation
- ✅ Data migration with proper joins
- ✅ Safe table dropping with IF EXISTS
- ✅ Index creation for performance
- ✅ Constraint validation
- ✅ Handles both IT and NX domains

### 4. Deployment Script Analysis ✅

**Deployment Process:**
1. **Environment Check** - Verify Docker status
2. **Backup Phase** - Create timestamped backups
3. **Database Migration** - Execute schema changes
4. **Application Updates** - Update web files
5. **Validation & Testing** - Comprehensive testing
6. **Cleanup** - Remove temporary files

**Validation Features:**
- ✅ Container health checks
- ✅ Database connection testing
- ✅ Website accessibility testing
- ✅ TO summary functionality verification
- ✅ Field count validation

## Schema Changes Overview

### IT Domain Changes
```sql
-- OLD STRUCTURE
projects (id, project_name, spip_ip, ip, ...)
dv_tasks (id, project_id, dv_engineer, digital_designer, ...)

-- NEW STRUCTURE
it_domain_projects (
  id, task_index, project_name, spip_ip, ip, ip_postfix,
  ip_subtype, alternative_name, spip_url, wiki_url, spec_version,
  spec_path, dv_engineer, digital_designer, business_unit,
  analog_designer, inherit_from_ip, reuse_ip, created_at, updated_at
)
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Unified data structure eliminates JOIN operations
- Auto-generated task indices (TASK001, TASK002, etc.)
- Data validation constraints
- Performance optimization with indexes

### NX Domain Changes
```sql
-- ENHANCED TABLES
coverage_reports (with percentage validation 0-100%)
version_control (with URL validation)
imported_it_data (with business unit validation)

-- TO SUMMARY VIEW (33 fields)
to_summary_view (
  task_index, project, spip_ip, ip, ip_postfix, ip_subtype,
  alternative_name, line_coverage, fsm_coverage, interface_toggle_coverage,
  toggle_coverage, coverage_report_path, dv_engineer, digital_designer,
  business_unit, sanity_svn, sanity_svn_ver, release_svn, release_svn_ver,
  git_path, git_version, golden_checklist, golden_checklist_version,
  to_date, rtl_last_update, to_report_creation, spip_url, wiki_url,
  spec_version, spec_path, analog_designer, inherit_from_ip, reuse_ip
)
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Complete 33-field TO summary display
- Data validation constraints
- Enhanced joins for comprehensive reporting
- Proper handling of missing data

## Deployment Simulation Results

### Expected Deployment Timeline
- **Total Time:** 5-10 minutes
- **Backup Phase:** 1-2 minutes
- **Migration Phase:** 2-3 minutes
- **Validation Phase:** 2-3 minutes
- **Cleanup Phase:** 1 minute

### Expected Outcomes
1. **IT Domain Website (localhost:8080):**
   - Unified data entry interface
   - Auto-generated task indices
   - Enhanced data validation
   - Improved performance

2. **NX Domain Website (localhost:8081):**
   - Complete TO summary with 33 fields
   - Enhanced data validation
   - Proper coverage percentage handling
   - Improved data integrity

3. **Database Performance:**
   - Reduced JOIN operations
   - Optimized indexes
   - Constraint validation
   - Better data integrity

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Docker not installed
```bash
# Solution
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

**Issue:** Permission denied
```bash
# Solution
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

**Issue:** Containers not starting
```bash
# Solution
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Issue:** Database connection failed
```bash
# Solution
docker-compose exec it-domain-web php /var/www/test-db-connection.php
docker-compose exec nx-domain-web php /var/www/test-db-connection.php
```

### Rollback Procedure
If deployment fails:
```bash
# Emergency rollback
./rollback-fixes.sh

# Manual rollback
docker-compose down
# Restore from backup directory
cp -r backups/[timestamp]/it-domain-backup/* it-domain/
cp -r backups/[timestamp]/nx-domain-backup/* nx-domain/
docker-compose up -d
```
